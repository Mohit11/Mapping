# RoboND-Mapping
Implementing variant of GraphSLAM RTAB-Map for 3D mapping indoor environment by a mobile robot using Kinect and Hokuyo laser sensor data. 

This project explains implementation of a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm towards generating a map of an indoor environment by a mobile robot while it navigates though the setting. The robot model attached with a Hokuyo laser range finder and a Kinect RGB-D camera uses a graph based SLAM algorithm - Real Time Appearance Based Mapping (RTAB-Map) to map the surroundings. Performance in mapping the environment is first analyzed on a pre-set kitchen dining Gazebo world and later it is tested on a user built room Gazebo world. Finally, the 2D occupancy grid map and the 3D octomap generated by RTAB-Map, for both scenarios, are examined for loop closures and are evaluated based on their accuracy in portraying actual environment characteristics.
